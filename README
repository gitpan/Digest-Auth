1. DESCRIPTION:
--------------------------------

This module attempts to provide a means for easily building a reasonably 
secure perl application using one way secure hash algorythms. This should 
not be a replacement for other security precautions such as SSL, SSH, etc. 
but instead an additional layer of protection to prevent common types of 
attacks which many perl applications are susceptable to.

This library idealy works in conjuction with client side hash algorythms to 
provide a much more secure method of athenticating users although you can 
opt to not use an client side hashing for the sake of compatibility.

This module is licensed under the GPL.  
See the LICENSE section below for more details.

2. DOCUMENTATION:
--------------------------------

The documentation is in Auth.pm in the form of POD format 
perldocs.  Even the above text might be out of date, so be sure to
check the perldocs for the straight truth!

--------------------------------
3. INSTALLATION:
--------------------------------

In case this is your first module, the usual methods are:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install
        
If you are on a windows box you should use 'nmake' rather than 'make'. 
You can get nmake from Microsoft.com (as of this writing: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/132084) 
Just copy it into the install path of Perl ("C:\Perl\bin" directory) 
and run it, then you can use the commands:    

        perl Makefile.PL
        nmake
        nmake test
        nmake install

If you plan to use the shared memory cache you might want to test it
before you install.  Make sure you have an up-to-date copy of
IPC::SharedCache installed (available from the same place you got
Digest::Auth, either CPAN or SourceForge) and then do:

       TEST_SHARED_MEMORY=1 make test
       
Or use a memory sandbox like sandboxie if your on windows.

5. MOTIVATION:
--------------------------------

Session based user access is key to nearly every internet and intranet 
application. While there have been a few attempts to make a secure hash 
login library they have had several short comings such as poor documentation, 
support, weak algoryms (such as MD5), a poor design, etc. This library 
seeks to fill an important gap to help make perl applications more secure.
